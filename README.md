# DonateAndHelp

## Project title:

 Our project name is **"DonateAndHelp"** which is a platform on a website and mobile application that connects beneficiaries with donors in order to receive money donations from donors, in a response to the fundraising campaigns uploaded by beneficiaries on the platform. In addition, donors can upload their items for donations they want to donate for any beneficiaries.

## Motivation:

 We founded **"DonateAndHelp"** to connect beneficiaries with donors in Jordan and MENA region, as we have observed an alarming gap in the online donation software market in the region, so we set out to create the simplest solution around here. **"DonateAndHelp"** can build bridges between beneficiaries and donors, where beneficiaries can receive money donations online for their fundraising campaigns, as well as donors can upload their items for donations for any beneficiaries.
